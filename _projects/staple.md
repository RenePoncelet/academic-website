<p align="justify">
Our understanding of the universe's fundamental building blocks is primarily determined by measurements in earth-based scattering experiments at high energies like those conducted at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The precise comparison between measured scattering cross-sections and first-principle theory predictions allows us to distinguish and constrain different models of microscopic physics. This strategy led to the Standard Model of Particle Physics (SM).
</p>

<p align="justify">
Despite the SM's success, there remain open questions related to particle physics: the matter-antimatter asymmetry, the origin and decomposition of dark matter, and the nature of electroweak symmetry breaking. These can be addressed through measurements in high-energy scattering experiments. The data collected at the LHC and future colliders will allow stress testing of the SM. Additionally, reinterpreted, these will constrain new physics to energies far beyond the direct production capabilities. The challenge for theory is to match this precision to take maximal advantage of this potential.
</p>

<p align="justify">
Predictions from the SM are derived from perturbation theory in Quantum Field Theory. Including higher orders in the perturbative expansion and all-order resummation systematically improves accuracy. Higher orders in Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) are especially essential for LHC physics. Accordingly, the European particle physics strategy update recognises precision phenomenology and the corresponding development of techniques and tools as the key to a successful third data-taking period and high-luminosity upgrade of the LHC.

STAPLE aims to combine insights from recent progress in second-order perturbative QCD computations and understanding the logarithmic accuracy of parton-shower simulations to develop a precision event simulation at NNLO+PS accuracy. The event simulation will deliver accurate and precise predictions for scattering processes and will be a STAPLE of precision physics at the LHC and beyond.
