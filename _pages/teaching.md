<h1> Quantum Field Theory </h1>

Fridays, 12:00 - 13:30, March-June 2025 (10 lectures)

First lecture: 21st March 2025, room MSD

Rene Poncelet and Sebastian Sapeta (IFJ PAN)

In this lecture, we will present the path from the foundations of Quantum Field Theory to its applications in particle physics. Starting from Lagrangian, we shall construct perturbation theory, define a cross-section, and arrive at Feynman rules for scalar theory, Quantum Electrodynamics, and Quantum Chromodynamics. Then, we will use those tools to perform step-by-step calculations of basic scattering processes at tree level and one loop.

The lecture will be given on a blackboard and address PhD students, postdocs, and all researchers interested in systematizing their knowledge of QFT. Weekly exercises and solutions are also provided to review the lecture content. It assumes familiarity with quantum mechanics and special relativity. All the remaining prerequisites, i.e., relativistic quantum mechanics and classical field theory, will be reviewed during the lecture.
