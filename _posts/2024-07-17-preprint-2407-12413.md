<h4> Quark Mass Effects in Higgs Production </h4>

<b>Authors:</b> Micha≈Ç Czakon, Felix Eschment, Marco Niggetiedt, Rene Poncelet, Tom Schellenberger

<b>Abstract:</b> We examine the effect of finite top- and bottom-quark masses on the Higgs production cross section in the gluon-gluon fusion channel. We employ both MSbar and on-shell renormalisation for the quark masses and provide a thorough comparison. Furthermore, we explore alternative treatments of quark masses, in particular in the four-flavour scheme, and investigate their impact on the cross section. Our work also presents novel predictions for differential cross sections in the Higgs rapidity. The results lead to a significant reduction of scale uncertainties, and our analysis enables us to offer well-grounded recommendations for future research in this area.
