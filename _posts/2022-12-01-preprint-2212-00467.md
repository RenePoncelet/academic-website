<h4> A detailed investigation of W+c-jet at the LHC </h4>

<b>Authors:</b> Micha≈Ç Czakon, Alexander Mitov, Mathieu Pellen, Rene Poncelet

<b>Abstract:</b> State-of-the-art analyses of W+c-jet production at the LHC require precise predictions. In the present work, we study in detail the impact of off-diagonal CKM elements up to next-to-next-to leading order in QCD, the influence of flavored jet algorithms, and the size of electroweak corrections. In addition, we also investigate phenomenological aspects related to the exact definition of the process. We find that all these effects can be of the order of several per cent for both the fiducial cross section and differential distributions. They are, therefore, very relevant for the interpretation of current and upcoming measurements.
