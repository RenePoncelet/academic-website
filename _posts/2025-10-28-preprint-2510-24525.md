<h4> Associated production of a W-boson and a charm meson at NNLO in QCD </h4>

<b>Authors:</b> Terry Generet, Rene Poncelet, Miha Muškinja

<b>Abstract:</b> The production of heavy-flavor hadrons in association with a vector boson in proton-proton collisions is a powerful probe for studying Quantum Chromodynamics and the content of protons. In this article, we provide, for the first time, differential predictions through NNLO for the production of W±D∓ final states. The results are compared to recent ATLAS measurements, and the sensitivity to the strange content of the proton is investigated by PDF profiling. The results are found to be promising for including W±D∓ measurements in proton-proton collisions in PDF fits.
