<h4> Open B production at hadron colliders in NNLO+NNLL QCD </h4>

<b>Authors:</b> Michał Czakon, Terry Generet, Alexander Mitov, Rene Poncelet

<b>Abstract:</b> We report on a calculation of open heavy-flavor production at hadron colliders which extends to next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) accuracy the classic NLO-accurate formalism developed almost 30 years ago under the acronym FONLL. The approach retains the exact heavy-flavor mass dependence at low transverse momentum, pT, and resums collinear logarithms through next-to-next-to-leading log (NNLL) at high pT. Provided are predictions for B-hadrons as well as B-decay products like J/Ψ and muons. The main features of the NNLO+NNLL results are reduced scale dependence and moderate NNLO correction, consistent with perturbative convergence in a wide range of kinematic scales from few GeV up to asymptotically large values of pT. The new calculation significantly improves the agreement with data for B-hadrons and muons. We uncover an intriguing discrepancy in J/Ψ final states which may point to a lower value of the B→J/Ψ decay rate.
