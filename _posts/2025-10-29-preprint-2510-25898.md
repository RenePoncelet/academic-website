<h4> Precise predictions for joint polarisation fractions in WZ production at the LHC </h4>

<b>Authors:</b> Giovanni Pelliccioli, Rene Poncelet

<b>Abstract:</b> We achieve for the first time NNLO QCD + NLO EW accuracy for doubly polarised WZ inclusive production at the LHC, in the case of fully leptonic decays. Additionally, we provide estimates for missing higher-order uncertainties in QCD associated with doubly polarised differential cross sections and joint polarisation fractions, obtained both with standard scale variations and with a theory-nuisance-parameter approach. The study is carried out in the fiducial setup of a recent ATLAS analysis of Run-2 data.
