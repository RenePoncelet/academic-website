<h4> A first next-to-next-to-leading order study of three-jet production at the LHC </h4>

<b>Authors:</b> Michal Czakon, Alexander Mitov, Rene Poncelet

<b>Abstract:</b> Multi-jet rates at hadron colliders provide a unique possibility for probing Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), the theory of strong interactions. By comparing theory predictions with collider data, one can directly test perturbative QCD, extract fundamental parameters like the strong coupling Î±s and search for physics beyond the Standard Model. In this work we calculate, for the first time, the next-to-next-to-leading (NNLO) QCD corrections to typical three-jet observables and to differential three-to-two jet ratios. We demonstrate that the inclusion of the NNLO corrections significantly reduces the dependence of those observables on the factorization and renormalization scales. Besides its phenomenological value, this proof-of-principle computation represents a milestone in perturbative QCD.
