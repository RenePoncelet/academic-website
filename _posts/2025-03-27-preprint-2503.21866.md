<h4> Small radius inclusive jet production at the LHC through NNLO+NNLL </h4>

<b>Abstract:</b> The study of hadronic jets and their substructure at hadronic colliders is crucial for improving our understanding of QCD, and searching for new physics. As such, there has been a significant effort to improve their theoretical description. In the small radius limit, inclusive jet production exhibits a universal factorization, enabling the resummation of logarithms which greatly stabilizes theoretical predictions. In this paper, we show how to combine a recently introduced framework for small-R resummation with the STRIPPER subtraction formalism for fragmentation, enabling next-to-next-to-leading order calculations of small-R inclusive jet production for a wide variety of processes at the LHC. We extract the two-loop constants for the jet functions, enabling for the first time next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic resummation matched to next-to-next-to-leading order perturbative calculation. We compare with CMS data for small-R jet production, and find that our results greatly improve the accuracy of the predictions at small-R, and stabilize the perturbative convergence and error estimates at larger R. Our approach is applicable to a wide class of jet substructure observables exhibiting similar factorization theorems, opening the door to an NNLO jet substructure program at the LHC.
