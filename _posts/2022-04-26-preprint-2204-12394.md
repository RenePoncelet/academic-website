<h4> Angular coefficients in W+j production at the LHC with high precision </h4>

<b>Authors:</b> Mathieu Pellen, Rene Poncelet, Andrei Popescu, Timea Vitos

<b>Abstract:</b> The extraction of the W-boson mass, a fundamental parameter of the Standard Model, from hadron-hadron collision requires precise theory predictions. In this regard, angular coefficients are crucial to model the dynamics of W-boson production. In this work, we provide, for the first time, angular coefficients at NNLO QCD + NLO EW accuracy for finite transverse momentum W-boson at the LHC. The corrections can reach up to 10% in certain regions of phase space. They are accompanied by a significant reduction of the scale uncertainty. This work should, besides providing reference values for theory-data comparison, provide state-of-the-art theory input for W-boson mass measurements.
