<h4> Flavour anti-kT algorithm applied to Wbb¯ production at the LHC </h4>

<b>Authors:</b> Heribertus Bayu Hartanto, Rene Poncelet, Andrei Popescu, Simone Zoia

<b>Abstract:</b> We apply the recently proposed flavoured anti-kT jet algorithm to Wbb¯ production at the Large Hadron Collider at s√=8 TeV. We present results for the total cross section and differential distributions at the next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) in QCD. We discuss the effects of the remaining parametric freedom in the flavoured anti-kT prescription, and compare it against the standard flavour-kT algorithm. We compare the total cross section results against the CMS data, finding good agreement. The NNLO QCD corrections are significant, and their inclusion substantially improves the agreement with the data.
