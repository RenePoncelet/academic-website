<h4> NNLO QCD corrections to diphoton production with an additional jet at the LHC </h4>

<b>Authors:</b> Herschel A. Chawdhry, Michal Czakon, Alexander Mitov, Rene Poncelet

<b>Abstract:</b> We calculate the NNLO QCD corrections to diphoton production with an additional jet at the LHC. Our calculation represents the first NNLO-accurate prediction for the transverse momentum distribution of the diphoton system. The improvement in the accuracy of the theoretical prediction is significant, by a factor of up to four relative to NLO QCD. Our calculation is exact except for the finite remainder of the two-loop amplitude which is included at leading color. The numerical impact of this approximated contribution is small. The results of this work are expected to further our understanding of the Higgs boson sector and of the behavior of higher-order corrections to LHC processes.
