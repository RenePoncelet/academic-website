<h4> Two-loop leading-colour QCD helicity amplitudes for two-photon plus jet production at the LHC </h4>

<b>Authors:</b> Herschel A. Chawdhry, Michal Czakon, Alexander Mitov, Rene Poncelet

<b>Abstract:</b> We calculate the complete set of two-loop leading-colour QCD helicity amplitudes for γγj-production at hadron colliders. Our results are presented in a compact, fully-analytical form.
