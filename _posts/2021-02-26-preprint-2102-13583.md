<h4> NNLO QCD study of polarised W+W− production at the LHC </h4>

<b>Authors:</b> Rene Poncelet, Andrei Popescu

<b>Abstract:</b> Longitudinal polarisation of the weak bosons is a direct consequence of Electroweak symmetry breaking mechanism providing an insight into its nature, and is instrumental in searches for physics beyond the Standard Model. We perform a polarisation study of the diboson production in the pp→e+νeμ−ν¯μ process at NNLO QCD in the fiducial setup inspired by experimental measurements at ATLAS. This is the first polarisation study at NNLO. We employ the double-pole approximation framework for the polarised calculation, and investigate NNLO effects arising in differential distributions.
