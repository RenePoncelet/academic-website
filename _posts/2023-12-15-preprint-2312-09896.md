<h4> Top-Bottom Interference Contribution to Fully-Inclusive Higgs Production </h4>

<b>Authors:</b> Michał Czakon, Felix Eschment, Marco Niggetiedt, Rene Poncelet, Tom Schellenberger

<b>Abstract:</b> We evaluate the top-bottom interference contribution to the fully-inclusive Higgs production cross section at next-to-next-to-leading order in QCD. Although bottom-quark-mass effects are power-suppressed, the accuracy of state-of-the-art theory predictions makes an exact determination of this effect indispensable. The total effect of the interference at 13 TeV is −1.99(1)+0.30−0.15 pb, while the pure O(α4s) correction is 0.43 pb. With this result, we address one of the leading theory uncertainties of the cross section.
